These scripts can help you in deploying FilmYou.

You need Netflix Prize dataset and some IMDB dataset (e.g., the one provided by TheOMDbAPI).

Just follow the order of execution of the Makefile.

`users_django.py` script requires special instructions. For more information, see the script documentation.
